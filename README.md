# OpenTelemetry Go Compile Instrumentation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a work in progress and not ready for production use. ðŸš¨

This project provides a tool to automatically instrument Go applications with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) at compile time. It modifies the Go build process to inject OpenTelemetry code into the application without requiring manual changes to the source code.

## Getting Started

1. Build the otel tool
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation.git
$ cd opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation
$ make build
```

2. Build the application with the tool and run it
```bash
$ make demo
```
